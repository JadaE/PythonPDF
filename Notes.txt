## What do I mean "create pdfs with Python" ## *should I use the word "create"?.. "Python and PDFs"*
    What is a pdf?
        A pdf is a $portable document format$ developed by Adobe in '93. It can include text, images, and links independent from the OS.
    How could it be created in python? $I thought .pdf was it's file type, not .py$
        There are python libraries that allow you to add text and images as well as allign content to a page the exact way you want it 
    Why would I create a PDF in Python?
        Creating a pdf in Word can be easier if you are only creating 1 unique document. A use case for creating on Python would be that 
        a person could create many unique pdfs as once, personalizing each one but having them follow the same structure. Many Unique PDFs.

## Different things to do with the power of creating pdfs in python ##
    - Can turn a text file or html into a pdf
    - If you have many people needing a slightly different PDF, Python makes the creation easy
    - Extract text from pdf **

## How? ##
    $*Empasis on the 2 different libraries?*$
    -import fpdf - free to use & doesn't need an api
        stands for free pdfs
        support from py 2.5-3.7
        can manage header, footer, format, & margin
        has yellow line bc need to
    -import pypdf2
        this is for reading pdfs.. reading is just a bonus
    -you will have to pip install it
        pip install fpdf
        or
        py -m pip install fpdf 

## Do I need anything extra other than Python? ##
    Outside of downloading Python, nope!

## Can you write pdfs with this? ##
    (demo)
        *Live code - show creation of file and everything
        Comment everything even if it is live.. use this time to talk about things*
        -
    Many/unique?

## Can you read pdfs with this? - a bonus ##
    On top of creating a pdf in Python, you can also read pdfs in Python
        A use case for this would be pulling data off a pdf easily 
        (text->voice or whatever project you have in mind)

    (demo)
    many/unique?

## What have I done with this? ##
    Loteria Board (Don't spend more than 8 min on this)
        -why I know so much
            $RH logo$
            I was the director of hacker expierence for a hackathon in 2020, which meant I made all of the side events
            2 weeks before our event, covid & quarentine hit and we had to make the whole hackathon virtual
            So I had to turn our planned Loteria event digital
            How would I give each hacker a unique RowdyHacks theamed board? 
            $pics of boards I made$
            I was able to make 500 unique board in our theme that the hackers could access through a secured link
            And all create in only a few days, if not hours
        -show then demo code
            Some things here will outside of our scope
            There will be things that could've been done better, but I did make this days before 
                and the code was only used for myself so bare that in mind
            *explain quickly*
            *have pdf to the right - split ide right*
        -If you want to run or play with this code, it is public on github 
            $https://github.com/JadaE/RH_Loteria$ 
            $qr code$

***## Other neat things ## *Will there be time for this??*
    mini demos
        - text file -> pdf
        - html -> pdf
