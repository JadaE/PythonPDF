## What do I mean "create pdfs with Python ##
What is a pdf?
    A pdf is a $portable document format$ developed by Adobe in '93. It can include text, images, and links independent from the OS.
How could it be created in python? I thought .pdf was it's file type, not .py
    There is a python library that allows you to add text and images as well as allign content to a page the exact way you want it 
Why would I create it in Python?
    Creating a pdf in Word can be easier if you are only creating 1 unique document. A use case for creating on Python would be that 
    a person could create many unique pdfs as once, personalizing each one but having them follow the same structure. Many Unique PDFs.

    Another would be pulling data off a pdf easily (text->voice or whatever project you have in mind)

## Different things to do with it ##
